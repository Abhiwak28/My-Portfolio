# UI Enhancement Suggestions (Round 2)

You've already added **3D Tilt** and **Scroll Progress**! Here are more advanced ideas to take it to the next level:

## 1. Thematic Visuals (Video Editor Vibe)
- **Film Grain Overlay**: Add a subtle, moving noise/grain texture over the entire website. This gives it a cinematic, "shot on film" look that fits your brand perfectly.
- **Glitch Text Effect**: Animate the "Namaste/Hello" text in the Hero section with a digital glitch effect instead of a simple fade.

## 2. Interactive Elements
- **Magnetic Buttons**: Make the "View My Work" and "Hire Me" buttons physically stick to and follow the cursor slightly when hovered.
- **Spotlight Cards**: Add a "flashlight" effect to your cards (What I Do / Case Studies) where a glow follows your mouse cursor *inside* the card borders.

## 3. Polish & Details
- **Custom Selection Color**: Change the text highlight color (when you select text) from the default blue to your brand's **Orange (#F97316)**.
- **Smooth Section Reveal**: Make sections "unblur" as they scroll into view, rather than just fading in.

## 4. Footer Impact
- **Massive CTA**: Add a huge, bold typography section at the bottom saying **"LET'S CREATE"** that fills the screen width before the footer links.

**Recommendation:**
I strongly suggest the **Film Grain Overlay** and **Glitch Text** next. They will immediately reinforce your identity as a high-end video creator.
